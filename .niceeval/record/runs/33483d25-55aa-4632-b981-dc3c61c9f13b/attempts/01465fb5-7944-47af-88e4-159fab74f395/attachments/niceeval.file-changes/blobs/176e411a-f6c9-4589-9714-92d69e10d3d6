## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This is a Rust CLI project (`toggl-cli`) — an unofficial CLI for Toggl Track time-tracking service.

### Quick reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Build | `cargo build` |
| Test | `cargo test` |
| Lint (format) | `cargo fmt --check` |
| Lint (clippy) | `cargo clippy` |
| Run | `cargo run -- <subcommand>` |

### Non-obvious notes

- **System dependencies required**: `libdbus-1-dev`, `libssl-dev`, and `pkg-config` must be installed on Linux before building. These are needed by the `keyring` and `openssl-sys` crates respectively.
- **Rust toolchain**: The project uses `rust-toolchain.toml` to pin the stable channel. Rustup will automatically select the correct toolchain.
- **Runtime authentication**: Most CLI commands require a Toggl API token. Set via `toggl auth <TOKEN>` or the `TOGGL_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Without a token, commands like `list`, `start`, `stop` will print a message asking you to authenticate first.
- **No services to run**: This is a standalone CLI binary with no databases, containers, or background services. Just build and run.
- **openssl deprecation warning**: The current `openssl v0.10.48` dependency produces a future-incompatibility warning during build. This is cosmetic and does not affect functionality.
- **Mock trait for testing**: `ApiClient` trait uses `mockall::automock` for unit tests. When adding new methods to the trait, the mock is auto-generated, but all test files that construct `User` structs must include all fields (including optional ones added later).
- **Code style for new commands**: Follow the existing pattern — each command gets its own file under `src/commands/`, a struct with `pub async fn execute(...)`, and must be registered in `src/commands/mod.rs`, `src/arguments.rs`, and `src/main.rs` (routing).
- **Command structure**: Commands use a kubectl-style `verb noun` pattern. Grouped verbs (`create`, `delete`, `edit`, `rename`) have sub-enums (`CreateEntity`, `DeleteEntity`, `EditEntity`, `RenameEntity`) in `src/arguments.rs`. Standalone commands (`start`, `stop`, `list`, etc.) remain as direct variants of `Command`.
