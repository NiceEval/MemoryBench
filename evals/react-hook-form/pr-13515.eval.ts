// 挖自真实合入 PR react-hook-form/react-hook-form#13515(不让被测 agent 看到 PR 号/commit/URL):
// deepEqual() 的循环引用防护把「已访问过的对象」全塞进一个共享 WeakSet,只要本次比较里任何一侧
// 曾经在别处出现过,就直接判 true——导致两个只是复用了同一个对象引用(并非真正循环)的结构被
// 误判为相等。真实修复把 visited 从单个 WeakSet 换成 WeakMap<object, WeakSet<object>>,只有
// 「这一对」对象曾经被彼此比较过才短路为 true,真正的循环引用防护(避免爆栈)不受影响。
// 隐藏测试见 fixtures,两个文件合起来才能验证修复:deepEqual.test.ts 里已有一个循环引用用例,
// 一个「只删掉 visited 防护」的作弊修复能让新增的复用引用断言通过,但会在那个循环引用用例上
// 爆栈——所以 run-tests.sh 对 deepEqual.test.ts 是整份跑,不按 test name 抠。

          "Bug: react-hook-form has an internal `deepEqual` utility that recursively compares two values for " +
          "structural equality (used, among other things, to decide whether a form's current values actually " +
          "changed on a rerender). To avoid infinite recursion on self-referential / circular structures, " +
          "`deepEqual` keeps track of which objects it has already visited while walking into a comparison, and " +
          "short-circuits to \"equal\" once it re-encounters something it's already seen. The bug is in how that " +
          "tracking works: it records every object it walks into in a single shared collection, and treats an " +
          "object as \"already compared\" — returning true — as soon as EITHER side of the current comparison has " +
          "been seen ANYWHERE before, even in a completely different part of the structure. Equality becomes " +
          "sticky: once some object has participated in one comparison, any later comparison that involves that " +
          "same object again short-circuits to equal, regardless of what it's actually being compared against " +
          "this time. This produces wrong results for plain, non-circular data that simply reuses the same object " +
          "reference in more than one place. For example, given a shared object `shared = { value: 1 }`: " +
          "`deepEqual({ first: shared, second: shared }, { first: { value: 1 }, second: { value: 2 } })` should " +
          "return false (second: 1 !== 2), but returns true — because `shared` was already \"visited\" while " +
          "comparing `first`, so the comparison for `second` short-circuits to equal even though `shared.value` " +
          "does not match `{ value: 2 }`. This is user-visible: when a form is re-rendered with new external " +
          "values (e.g. via the `values` option) and the new values object happens to reuse a nested object " +
          "reference from elsewhere in the same values tree, the form's internal change-detection treats fields " +
          "that reuse that reference as unchanged even when their actual target value differs, so the form can " +
          "silently keep showing a stale value for a field after a rerender that should have updated it.\n\n" +
          "Any fix has to satisfy both of these at once: (1) genuinely circular structures (an object that, " +
          "directly or through a chain of references, eventually points back to itself) must still be handled " +
          "without recursing forever / blowing the call stack, and (2) an object being reused in more than one " +
          "place in an otherwise non-circular structure must NOT, by itself, cause unrelated comparisons " +
          "elsewhere in the structure to be treated as equal — \"this object was involved in some earlier " +
          "comparison\" is not the same fact as \"this object was already compared against this instance\", and " +
