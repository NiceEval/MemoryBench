// real fix: react-tooltip PR #1271 (merge 013931f2c362d8971e578f41a3b7c739ea74b520),
// which lands on top of BASE_COMMIT (its first parent, == baseRefOid here). Bug 1: the
// delegated mouseout/focusout close listeners only look at whether the event target is
// inside whatever anchor is currently marked "active", instead of resolving which
// anchor the event's own target actually belongs to, so anchor detection during
// hover/focus transitions between related anchor elements is unreliable. Bug 2: the
// delayed-show callback checks "is the tooltip already rendered, so skip the delay"
// against a value captured in its memoized closure instead of a ref read at call time,
// so that check can be stale by the time a deferred delayShow timer actually fires.
